This sub-directory holds the implementation and results of experimentation for the unsupervised deep learning approach covered in the report. Note that the directory is simply a 
copy of the github repo for the original implementation provided by the papers authors whose links are provided below. The results of experimentation on the image pairs are also 
presented in the image reconstruction directory. The images used in the experimentation were also taken from the authors of this deep learning approaches paper and can be found 
through the original repo for this project. As opposed to the classical approach this code has been implemented as standard python files and should be ran according to the 
procedure outlined by the original authors on their repo.

The code presented in unsupervised deep learning directory is simply a copy of the implementation that was cited in the paper and provided with the paper, "Unsupervised Deep Image 
Stitching: Reconstructing Stitched Features to Images". The original repo for this project can be found here: https://github.com/nie-lang/UnsupervisedDeepImageStitching and the 
original paper can be found here:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12859.pdf.
