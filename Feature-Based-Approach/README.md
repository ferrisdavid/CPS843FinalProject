This sub-directory holds the files for the classical feature-based approach to the image stitching task, the base code is given as well as the input image pairs and results for 
each pair that was used during experimentation. To use the code it can be ran through Google Colab, ensure that the image files are in your current working directory and are named 
the same as referenced within the notebook.

The results of each experiment for the image pairs are presented in their own separate notebook for ease of use and viewing.
